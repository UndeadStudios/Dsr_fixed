Points of Interest List
Location___________________	Description_____________________________________________________X-Pos_____________Y-Pos
Duel Arena		The duel arena. (Directly above shapes room.			3364		3240

Good looking Mine		This is in rellakah. Rune rocks places here and closely gaurded by
			rock golems would be quite cool.

Champions Guild		The champions guild...					3191		3363


Dungeon List
Location___________________	Description_____________________________________________________X-Pos_____________Y-Pos

No Name			Empty L-shape region. Could be used to build a small city or		2630		9351
			training area.

The temple of Ikov		Could become a monsters lair. Could be used as a fortress.		2658		9828

Lumbridge Tunnel		The tunnel that runs from lumbridge cellar.			3222		9618

Shapes Room		The shapes room that is often used for 'Torso' games.		3364		3240

Glarials Tomb		A small tomb. Nothing special really.				2542		9818

Unknown	1		Unknown area. Could be a good location for fighting.		2387		9816

Gnome Workshop		The gnome workshop. Possible training area. Possible quest area.	2396		9874

Fight Pit?			A possible location for a fightpit. Possible viewing area's at		2402		9703
			either end.

Unknown	2		A good site for mage/range training.				2397		9606

Castle Wars Dungeon	The Castle Wars dungeon. Another good location for fight pits.	2401		9503
			Rocks block exit, no escape! Ladders DO work.

Underground Maze		Well, that's what it looks like to me. Nice location for a mini-	2405		9426
			game. Maybe a hunting ground?

Mine			Could be turned into a mining area  I suppose.			3412		9633

Elemental Workshop	I love this place in Runescape. Maybe some good can come of 	2714		9890
			it? Would be wicked if filled with super-strong elementals killed
			in order to gain the mystic staffs!

Unknown 3		Some sort of agility course.					3540		9886

Underground Temple	Underground temple that leads to Canafis.			3439		9897

Varrock Sewers		Varock sewers. Enough said really. Could be turned into a great	3244		3893
			quest using the story about wally on runescape.			

Ice dungeon		The ice dungeon that you visit in the heroes quest in order to obtain	2822 		9907
			the ice gloves.

Glariala and Baxtorian	A room with a trophy in it. Could be used as a special way to retreive	2604		9900
			powerful items.						

Large Mine		A large mining area.						2459		9910

Cool looking pit-type 	A nice area that could be converted to fight pits with very little work.	2356		9910
looking area. 

Unknown 4		Rather pointless looking dungeon. Going to explore more...

Unknown 5		I first thought this was varock dungeon again, but it's seems a bit	2567		9605
			misplaced.

If there are any that I might have missed that are VERY important, send me a PM on moparscape.org. Thanks!
